A react application for personal finances tracking

Savey is a react app which allows you to insert income and expenses and analyze your personal finances.
Inspired (and meant to replace) my Excel-based personal finance tracker.

## What currently works
 - Adding expenses / income
 - Dashboard with running totals for month/year/all time

## What needs work
 - Period-based breakdown
 - Category breakdown
 - Managing a custom set of spending categories
 - Keeping data external to the app and tying it to authentication

## Running the app
Use `npm run start` or `yarn start` to start the development server
Use `npm run storybook` or `yarn storybook` to start the storybook server and see the component galery
